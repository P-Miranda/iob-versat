// TODO: Maybe it would be best if we just made the change to versat to do delay calculation in a port by port basis instead of just looking at the units themselves. This would extract a little bit more performace, use less hardware since we can have better fixed buffer allocations and we could even simplify a bit of the code, since the "out" unit already requires port based delay calculations.
